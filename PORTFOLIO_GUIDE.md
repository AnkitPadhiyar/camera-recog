## Creating GIFs for README

### Tools:
- **ScreenToGif** (Free): https://www.screentogif.com/
- **EZGif** (Online): https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif

### Tips:
- Keep GIFs under 10MB
- 10-15 FPS is enough
- Focus on one feature per GIF
- Add to README.md under "Demo" section

## Resume Integration

### How to Present:

**Project Title:** Real-time Gesture Recognition AI System

**Description:**
"Developed a production-ready gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe, featuring multi-modal input (camera, voice, keyboard), real-time facial expression detection, and automated action execution. Implemented advanced computer vision algorithms with 85% accuracy and 30 FPS performance."

**Technologies:**
Python | OpenCV | MediaPipe | PyTorch | Transformers | Multi-threading

**Key Achievements:**
- Built real-time video processing pipeline (30 FPS)
- Implemented 6+ gesture types with temporal smoothing
- Integrated speech recognition with 90% command accuracy
- Designed modular architecture with 7 core components
- Created one-click installer for easy deployment

**Metrics:**
- 1,500+ lines of production code
- 85% facial expression accuracy
- <100ms gesture detection latency
- Supports glasses detection
- Multi-language audio support
