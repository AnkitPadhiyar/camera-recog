# 🎯 Quick Start Guide for Recruiters

Thank you for reviewing my Gesture AI Agent project! This guide will help you test the application in **under 5 minutes**.

## ⚡ Quick Installation (Recommended)

### **One-Click Setup:**
1. **Double-click `INSTALL.bat`**
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for automatic setup
3. **Double-click `RUN.bat`** to start the application
4. That's it! 🎉

## 📋 What This Application Does

This is a **real-time AI-powered gesture recognition system** that:

- 🤚 Detects hand gestures (thumbs up, peace sign, pointing, etc.)
- 😊 Recognizes facial expressions (happy, sad, surprised, angry, neutral)
- 👁️ Tracks eye blinks for actions (single/double/triple blink patterns)
- 🎤 Processes voice commands (optional - requires microphone)
- 🎵 Plays mood-based music automatically
- 👓 Works with or without glasses
- 🌍 Supports multiple languages and mixed-genre music

## 🎮 How to Test

Once the application starts, you'll see a camera window. Try these:

### **1. Facial Expression Detection** (Automatic)
- **Smile** → Detects "Happy" mood
- **Frown** → Detects "Sad" mood  
- **Open eyes wide** → Detects "Surprised"
- **Furrow eyebrows** → Detects "Angry"

### **2. Blink Actions** (Automatic)
- **Single Blink** → Opens WhatsApp
- **Double Blink** (quick succession) → Takes Screenshot
- **Triple Blink** (quick succession) → Opens Notepad

### **3. Keyboard Controls**
- `m` - Toggle mood-based music
- `v` - Toggle voice commands
- `h` - Show action history
- `q` - Quit application

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Camera not opening?
- Allow camera permissions in Windows Settings
- Check if another app is using the camera
- Restart the application

### Voice commands not working?
- This is optional - other features still work
- Requires microphone and PyAudio library

### Application running slow?
- This is expected on first run (loading AI models)
- Performance improves after initialization
